### Brief

1. Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2. Me and Joe added as contributors
3. Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the challenges and list of what you delivered
4. pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5. The calculator should display the correct value for each button pressed in the browser
6. when the equals button is pressed you should display the result of the last entered calculation
7. the program should use functions, loops, DOM selectors and DOM events

### What went well:

Setting up the listeners on each button and setting the screen to display that value went smoothly.

### Challenges:

Saving the values of input numbers so that the calculation could be made proved difficult however a typo was the cause of this mistake which was noticed eventually.

### What was delivered:

All tasks in brief were completed.
